<h1 align=center>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
I'm a hobbyist programmer. I usually program large apps (~10K+ lines) and love learning the syntax of languages I use the most. You can usually find me writing code, although maybe not on this account. Feel free to reach out (somehow) if you take an interest in me.

If you're curious about me and what I do, I used to chiefly use Java but have since moved to C++, although it's going to be a while before I'm as good at C++ syntax as I am at Java's.

### Likes
Programming things I love:
1. Shortening code.
2. Going crazy with generics/generalizing functions, etc.
3. Extremely concise stuff.
4. Making APIs for apps, I guess.

### Opinions
1. I never program with a goal of making code "readable" in mind. If a more performant snippet is harder to read, then if someone wants to read it, they'd better learn to read.
2. I generally hate using other peoples' libraries. I write most of the stuff I need myself, and lots of public libraries suck/have garbage code. Plus dependency management is a nightmare. I like programming, not sorting out maven/gradle file versioning.
3. I hate higher-level languages like Python. They are substantially harder to learn than lower level ones like C or C++, because their syntax is much less consistent than those of lower level languages, like C or C++.
4. Most programmers are nitwits.
5. The industry is whack and Scrum is junk.

I hope that someone reads this and knows that not every other programmer on the planet is cucked.
